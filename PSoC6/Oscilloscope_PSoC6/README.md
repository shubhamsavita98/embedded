# Oscilloscope implementation using PSoC6
Code for Basic Oscilloscope implementation; ADC and DMA HAL drivers are configured to sample input voltage and the sampled input voltage is displayed on the UART. Better Serial Plotter is used to control time/amplitude divisions, analysis and visualization of the waveforms.

## Requirements

- PSoC6 CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 WiFi-Bluetooth Prototyping Kit
- Better Serial Plotter : https://hackaday.io/project/181686-better-serial-plotter
